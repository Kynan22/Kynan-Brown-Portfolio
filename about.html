                <p  id="aDesc">I'm starting my career as a junior developer and am looking for a position where I can apply my skills and experience. 
                    I am very passionate about programming and I am excited at the prospect of working in a field that I can gain experience and knowledge, in an area that excites me and which I thoroughly enjoy.<br><br>
                    I have experience in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP as well as skills in WordPress using a range of plugins. 
                    I have gained these skills through the completion of a Diploma of Information Technology which was completed in 2018. 
                    From this course I have also gained crucial knowledge of mobile application development, using Java and XML in the IDE Android Studio as well as databasing skills using SQL.<br><br>   
                    I thoroughly enjoy improving these skills in personal projects and I strive to learn new skills independently as much as possible.<br><br> 
                    I look forward to hearing from anyone interested in my work and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
